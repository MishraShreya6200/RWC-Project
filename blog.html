                Ranchi Women’s College has carved a niche for itself in the world of higher education for women in
                social
                sciences/ humanities, sciences and commerce. Emerging as a torch bearer in the field of Women Education
                Ranchi Women’s college has grown to be a Centre of Excellence in the domain of higher education for
                women of
                Jharkhand, Bihar. West Bengal and Orissa. Another feather was added to its cap when this College got
                Autonomy Status by the UGC with effect from 2011-12. The college has been innovating and introducing new
                courses in response to the demands of the students and the Job-market. The college has attempted to keep
                itself updated in knowledge and skills by combining the traditional subjects in Arts and Science with
                vocational subjects in the emerging areas such as Biotechnology, information technology etc. Since the
                traditional programmes in Arts, Science and Commerce have more of knowledge content and less of skill
                content, it is enriched through classroom discussions, seminars, tutorials, project work, networking
                with
                NGOs and lectures/workshops by experts from India and abroad.
